# Felix_P
This script will perform a removal of contents from file(s) without deleting the file.  
Written in Python, Felix_P is way faster than its predecessor, Felix.

> Usage: py felix.py [--type] [--path <str>]

- [--path] is optional, default value: os.path.expanduser('~\\Documents')
- Felix_P works recursively So, be careful!
